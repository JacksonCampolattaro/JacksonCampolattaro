*Independent Project* --
Building a multi-threaded dynamical simulation tool to improve my
familiarity with optimization, build tools, design patterns, and libraries.
Incorporated concepts including concurrency, event-driven programming,
serialization, cache-optimization, and tree algorithms among others.

### {{< split "Quarter ID" "*August 2020--June 2021*" >}}

*University Capstone Project* -- 
Lead a small team of interdisciplinary engineering students
to develop a solution which determines the value of collectible coins using machine vision.
Involved industrial imaging and lighting hardware, 
paired with a computer vision pipeline built with Python and OpenCV.
