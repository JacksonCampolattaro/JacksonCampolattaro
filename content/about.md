I'm an American student earning my Masters in computer engineering at TU Delft.
I'm currently seeking a software-focused thesis position in the Netherlands, 
with intentions to stay after my graduation.

## Interests

I'm drawn toward projects which involve:

- Open Source Software
- High Performance Computing
- Multithreaded Programming (Homogeneous, Heterogeneous, and SIMD)
- Modeling and Simulation 

## Hobbies

### Music

*The Apple music Favorites playlist is usually representative of the types of music I'm listening to at the moment.*

[//]: # (*I tend to listen to music by the album; these are some of my favorites in the last couple of years.*)

### Cycling

I love cycling for sport, to explore my neighborhood, as well as just to get to class.
