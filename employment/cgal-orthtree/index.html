which pairs students with open source projects.
Because of my <a href=https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/projects/n-body/>N-Body</a> project I was familiar with tree-based algorithms,
so I was drawn to CGAL&rsquo;s proposed Octree project.
I was paired with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simongiraudot/?originalSubdomain=fr">Simon Giraudot</a>
and worked remotely, corresponding by daily email and regular calls.</p><figure><img src=/img/employment/cgal-orthtree-structure.png alt="The boxes of an orthtree (black) produced by a point cloud (blue)"><figcaption><p><em>The boxes of an orthtree (black) produced by a point cloud (blue)</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>The goal of the project was to create a new CGAL package which provides an Octree data structure.
An Octree subdivides 3d space into a hierarchy which can be used to speed up certain types of searches.
CGAL already had one Octree implementation which was used internally by its Shape Detection package,
but it couldn&rsquo;t easily be generalized to other applications.
The Shape Detection package was the primary use-case which guided my API design,
and I also spoke with stakeholders at CGAL and Inria to determine which features would be most useful.</p><p>Working on a new package for CGAL was interesting,
because the organization makes use of C++ in ways I had never encountered before.
CGAL code is the most generic I have encountered, making heavy use of templates and template metaprogramming.
By the end of the project, I had a much stronger understanding of the language,
and of type theory in general.</p><figure><img src=/img/employment/cgal-orthtree-benchmark.png alt="Benchmark comparing the Octree to a similar data structure"><figcaption><p><em>Benchmark comparing the Octree to a similar data structure</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>The new Octree package was complete partway through the summer,
and I spent the remainder of the time transitioning the Shape Detection package to the new API,
optimizing and benchmarking, and writing documentation for the API.
After I returned to school, my mentor expanded the library to work in 2-dimensional space (Quadtree)
and in N-Dimensional space (Orthtree).
The Orthtree is now available to users of CGAL since version 5.3.</p><p>To learn more about the Octree project,
