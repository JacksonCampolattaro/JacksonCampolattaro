After the end of the summer I kept in touch with my mentor, and he put me in contact with his colleagues at Inria. Once I knew I would be attending graduate school in Europe we made arrangements for in-person work at Inria&amp;rsquo;s research campus in Sophia Antipolis, France.</description></item><item><title>Orthtree</title><link>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/employment/cgal-orthtree/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 10:28:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/employment/cgal-orthtree/</guid><description>Over the summer of 2020 I participated in Google&amp;rsquo;s Summer of Code program, which pairs students with open source projects. Because of my N-Body project I was familiar with tree-based algorithms, so I was drawn to CGAL&amp;rsquo;s proposed Octree project. I was paired with Simon Giraudot and worked remotely, corresponding by daily email and regular calls.

The goal of the project was to create a new CGAL package which provides an Octree data structure.</description></item><item><title>Inria SIMD Blog</title><link>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/employment/inria-simd-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:59:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/employment/inria-simd-blog/</guid><description>Note: This page is mirrored from my page on CGAL's internal wiki, apologies for any incorrect formatting.
