Because of my N-Body project I was familiar with tree-based algorithms, so I was drawn to CGAL&amp;rsquo;s proposed Octree project. I was paired with Simon Giraudot and worked remotely, corresponding by daily email and regular calls.

The goal of the project was to create a new CGAL package which provides an Octree data structure.</description></item></channel></rss>
