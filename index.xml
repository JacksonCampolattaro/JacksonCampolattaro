That preparation was ultimately redundant (it was an introductory course), but I enjoyed the work, and I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to add to the project during off periods, since.
The n-body problem is the algorithmic challenge of modeling the interactions between very large number of point masses &amp;ndash; for example, when simulating the formation of galactic clusters.</description></item><item><title>Spectrogram</title><link>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/projects/spectrogram/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 12:43:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/projects/spectrogram/</guid><description>Spectrogram was a 4 month (one-semester) project completed as part of my coursework at Virginia Tech. The assignment allowed for a lot of leeway when selecting a task; because of my interest in music, I wanted to build a spectrogram (a type of audio visualizer). I formed a group with two like-minded students, and we set out with the goal of making a cross-platform C++ program which would visualize the system&amp;rsquo;s audio streams.</description></item><item><title>Quarter Id</title><link>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/projects/quarter-id/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 11:25:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/projects/quarter-id/</guid><description>Quarter ID was an 8-month (two-semester) project completed in my last year at Virginia Tech as part of the university&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;capstone&amp;rdquo; program. The goal of the project was to design and build a system which coin collectors could use to identify and evaluate the condition of washington quarters.
I was paired with three other students, two studying electrical engineering, and one studying computer vision. The first half of the project was focused around designing the hardware; because of Covid-19 I was the only student on campus, so I did most of the construction.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 23:41:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Email j.campolattaro@student.tudelft.nl Github Linkedin</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 20:05:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jacksoncampolattaro.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m an American student earning my Masters in computer engineering at TU Delft.
